# -Polynomial-regression-with-gradient-descent

This repository contains an implementation of polynomial regression using PyTorch and an analysis of linear regression performance on a logarithmic function under different data ranges. The project demonstrates data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features

- **Polynomial Data Generation**: Generates synthetic polynomial data with noise.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Implements a polynomial regression model using PyTorch.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model with different hyperparameters and evaluates its performance.
- **Loss Visualization**: Tracks and visualizes training and validation loss over epochs.
- **Original vs Estimated Polynomial**: Compares the learned polynomial with the original function.
- **Linear Regression on Logarithmic Function**: Analyzes the impact of data range on linear regression performance.
